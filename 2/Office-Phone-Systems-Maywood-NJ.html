<p>Instead of utilizing standard phone lines, VoIP technology works with linked online networks and digitalizes analog voice calls and messages to send out communications to and from different parties. Conventional telephone service is circuit-switched, meaning there is a dedicated line (circuit) for each call, with a high level of quality we have concerned expect.
